        <h1>Chapter 1:</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The illegal trade in works of cultural heritage continues to grow at an increasing rate
          around the world. As of the 1st September 2016, Interpol, the International Criminal Police
          Organisation had recorded some 49,000 items in their stolen objects database, though the
          actual number is certainly much larger.
          The objects in circulation include both paintings and objects, ancient and modern.
          Just over half of all such items stolen between 1970 and 2014, however, were archaeological
          artefacts, whether taken from museums or excavated out of the earth.

        <p>Although trade in cultural property is notoriously difficult to trace, it is clear from Interpol's
          database that it flows largely in a single direction: from the less economically-developed to the
          more economically-developed world. Prices paid by dealers in market countries are usually hundreds of times
          that of their initial sale in the source country. Interpol estimates the illicit trade of cultural
          artefacts to be worth around $4.5 billion, with the biggest destination markets in the USA, the UK, France,
          Germany, Switzerland, and China.

        <p>From the source countries comes a steady flow of artefacts. Perhaps more important than the loss of
          historical information is the undermining cultural heritage as a resource for growth and jeopardising
          its future potential.
          In the 1980s and 90s, for example, the aesthetic “taste” for terracotta sculptures from the Inland
          Niger Delta in Mali left 80 to 90% of archaeological sites in the area looted. During the same
          period, the robbing of Nok culture sites on the Bauchi Plateau of central Nigeria so flooded
          the European and American markets with terracotta statuettes that their price crashed in a matter
          of years.

        <p>Although the word Nok is typically used monolithically to refer to the style of sculpture,
          it probably represents a number of different cultural groups that were present in the area
          between the beginning of the first millennium BC and the mid-first millennium AD. Terracotta
          statues of this style currently feature at number one on the Internation Council of Museum’s
          (ICOM) Red List of African archaeological objects at risk. Their report begins with the
          constation: “The looting of archaeological items and the destruction of archaeological sites in
          Africa are a cause of irreperable damage to African history and hence to the history of humankind.”

        <h1>Chapter 2:</h1>
        <h2>Supply</h2>
        <p>Many of the African archaeological artefacts that find themselves today in European or American
          museums made their way into such collections during the colonial period. Alongside several
          high-profile lootings, such as the British punitive expedition to Benin in 1897 or Leo Frobenius’s
          appropriation of works of Yoruba art from Ife-Ife in 1910, thousands of other pieces have ended up
          in private legacies through smaller acts of theft during this period. Nok terracottas, however,
          were not discovered until 1928, when the first examples were unearthed by tin mining operations near
          the village of Nok in cental Nigeria. Archaeological research on these objects was slow to take
          off, with the first significant study being undertaken by Bernard Fagg in the 1950s. By the 1980s,
          however, there had been a surge in the illegal export of these figurines, which peaked in the 1990s.

        <p>A report on the subject was made in the 1990s and based, in its own words, “on second-hand expatriate
          gossip in Lagos”. The report found that at the height of the looting, up to 10 terracottas were being
          excavated each day, adding up to some 3000 figurines total per year. The intensification of police
          efforts whittled the number of main traders down to just two by 1995, though both of these appeared to
          have employed around 1000 diggers each. Far from being a haphazard free-for-all  operation, the industry
          displayed a high degree of organization. Its methods of evading authorities, however, remained
          surpisingly simple. Instead of applying for archaeological permits that were hard to come by, diggers
          instead obtained mining accreditations, legally allowing them to dig in search of minerals.

        <p>At this early stage in the race, however, prices are not high. According to the report cited above,
          diggers in the 1990s might receive up to 1,000 Nigerian naira (around $45) for an exceptional piece.
          More recent articles cite slightly higher figures, though it is difficult to confirm their veracity.

        <h1>Chapter 3:</h1>
        <h2>Transfer</h2>
        <p>The transfer of artefacts from one country to another requires the active participation of at least
          two dealers who have in-depth knowledge of their respective markets. A good price for
          a Nok terracotta sold by a local dealer in the 1990s seems to have been in the region of 35,000 Nigerian
          naira (around $1,600), already an inflation of around 35 times that which was paid by the dealer to the
          digger. This in part reflects the level of risk shouldered by actors at this link in the chain. In
          order to export such objects, loopholes must be found or fake permits acquired. In another case,
          Subhash Kapoor, a dealer accused of looting artefacts from temples in southern India, achieved this by
          simply forging false signatures on paper with fake letterheads. He is currently on trial in Chennai.

      <div id="demand">
        <h1>Chapter 4:</h1>
        <h2>Demand</h2>
        <p>Although the European market for African antiquities has its roots in the first objects brought back
          from colonial wars, the widespread “taste” for them is a much more recent phenomenon. This perhaps
          traces its origin to the modernists, particularly Picasso, Man Ray and others, who incorporated motifs
          and styles found in African art into their own creations.

        <p>Following this were the landmark sales that form the folkloric heritage of the primitive arts market.
          The 1966 sale of the collection of Helena Rubenstein, a cosmetics mogul with a penchant for the arts
          of Sudanic cultures, was the first time African wooden sculpture attained 5-figure price-tags. The
          Hubert Goldet sale of 2001 was a major step up in terms of scale, with a substantial collection of
          600 objects fetching $11.3 million.

        <p>In recent years, it has been the sale in successive installments of the Pierre and Claude Vérité
          collection that has caused the primitive art world repeatedly revaluate itself. When this was first
          brought to market in 2006, the 514 lots brought in some $55 million. Of these, 8 pieces went beyond
          $1 million, setting a slew of new records in the course.

        <p>Today, demand is cultivated and satisfied by private galleries, auction houses, and public museums.
          Indeed, the opening of the Quai Branly museum in Paris in 2006 contributed greatly to the popularisation
          of this market. However, it is easy to underestimate the power of peer-to-peer sales through platforms
          such as ebay, the UK and USA branches of which enable more than 600,000 sales every year.

        <p>At this end of the chain, Nok figures can easily fetch between $20 to $30 thousand.

        <div id="conclusion">
        <h1>Chapter 5:</h1>
        <h2>Conclusion / Repatriation?</h2>
        <p>ICOM conclude their Red List of African antiquities at risk with an appeal to “museums, auction houses,
           art dealers, and collectors to stop buying them”. Indeed, to curtail demand in the market countries
           seems to be the most obvious and easily-enacted policy. Due to difficulties in provenancing stolen
           pieces, it becomes very difficult to prove the illegality of a transaction once an object reaches a
           market country. Despite several well-publicised cases in recent years of museums returning their
           artefacts to their home countries, the rate of repatriation in general is not favourable. As a
           percentage of all artefacts stolen from the African countries between 2006 and 2015, only 11.5% of
           objects were repatriated.

        <p>Nevertheless, in a further development, objects that have been part of museum collections for many
          years are slowly beginning to find their way home. The British Museum is currently in negotiations
          with the government of Nigeria to return the bronze plaques looted from the Oba’s palace in the old
          capital of the kingdom of Benin. In 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston set a precedent by
          returning a Nok figurine that it had bought from the Galerie Walu in Basel, Switzerland, which had
          been supplied along with a forged waiver of ownership from the Nigerian National Commission of Museums
          and Monuments (NCMM).

        <p>The moral case for returning such artefacts is strong. It can only be hoped that the act of returning
          carries with it more than just symbolic weight.
